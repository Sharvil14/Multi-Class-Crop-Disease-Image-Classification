# Multi-Class-Crop-Disease-Image-Classification
# Description:
This project develops a CNN model to classify crop diseases from images. It utilizes a dataset of over 20,000 images across 42 different classes, addressing the challenge of identifying various plant diseases to aid in early detection and treatment.
# Objective Methodology:
•	Organized and explored the dataset to understand class distribution.
•	Implemented a safe image parsing function with error handling for robust data loading using tf.data.
•	Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
•	Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
•	Built a Sequential CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
•	Compiled the model using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
•	Trained the model on the augmented training data.
# Key Technologies:
•	Python
•	TensorFlow
•	Keras
•	kagglehub
•	PIL (Pillow)
•	Matplotlib
# Outcome: 
The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a CNN for multi-class image classification of crop diseases. The model was trained and evaluated, showing the potential for automated disease identification.
# Business Relevance: 
Early and accurate detection of crop diseases is crucial for preventing significant yield losses in agriculture. This project provides a foundation for developing tools that can assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying and managing diseases, leading to improved crop health and increased productivity.
# Learning: 
This project provided valuable experience in handling large image datasets, implementing robust data loading pipelines with error handling, applying data augmentation techniques, building and training a custom CNN model for multi-class classification, and understanding the practical challenges of real-world image data.
